Instructions
-------

* That's my attempt at the Takeaway Challenge!
* Below is an example of how you can run the code on IRB
* The menu class has a default value with a few dishes, so no need to create your own
* Good luck ordering from a very bland looking menu (customers food reviews 1 out of 5 stars)

```sh
hello hello testing

```
